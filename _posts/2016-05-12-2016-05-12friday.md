2016-05-12/friday:

still enjoying the phrase 'permanent vacation' - turns out its an Aerosmith song, not the Beach Boys? tho could have sworn the other way around! it's also a movie and a song by some other group never heard of - so think the phrase is up for grabs... 

I like it so much better than minimalism - which, I know what I mean by it, but seems to strike so many people as cold and sterile and annoying... permanent vacation is what we were talking about on Sunday: 

that feeling you get when you're out of town and can't do anything about everything you left behind - ahhhh! that feeling you get when you're living in a hotel room - maybe 1 room to 2 or 3 of you, and it's fine - you have everything you need: bed, tv, bathroom - if you want to do anything else, you leave - the furnishings are attractive enough, but not precious...

you go outside more or relax inside more because there isn't the burden of home ownership - listening to several of my friends this week on all the things they have to do owning a good sized house - I was thinking, 'hmmm... I should sweep the floor maybe...' 

and it has to do with work and other parts of your life too - saving enough money so that everyday work ills don't become burdensome - you could always leave... I suspect most people don't really mind their jobs, it's HAVING to work that bugs them! so haven't figured out how that fits in yet - but on this beautiful, gorgeous morning it's interesting to play with the idea...
